            </p>
            <p>

            <p>
                Some of the instructions in this document are designated as <i>guidelines</i> in italics. Failure to follow these guidelines will not lead to immediate rejection, but instead to a notification from the category Moderator asking the submission to be corrected.

            <p>
                Repeated failures to follow guidelines may lead to the rejection of your submissions.
            </p>

            <h4>Bans and Downvotes</h4>
            <p>
                The following behaviors may lead to a temporary or permanent ban from Utopian:

            </ul>

            <h4>Post Writing and Style</h4>
            <p>
                To be accepted, submissions must be written in a formal and professional style. A moderator may reject a contribution if the writing is unprofessional or unclear.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The writing style should be formal and informative.</li>
                <li>The writing style should be professional and clear.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Guidelines:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><i>Sentences like: “Hello Utopians, What’s up Steemians, Dear friends” and similar informal greetings may lead to rejection.</i></li>

                <li><i>Submissions with grammar issues that make the content difficult to understand may be rejected.</i></li>
                <li><i>Failure to apply the templates provided in the editor for each category may lead to rejection. The standard contribution submission templates should be followed when detailing your contribution. However, templates can be edited and extended as long as the formatting is clear.</i></li>
                <li><i>Contributors may refer to the following resource when writing contribution submissions - <a href="https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/656/02/" target="_blank">https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/656/02/</a></i></li>
